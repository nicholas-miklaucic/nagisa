Work-in-progress bot for the Homework Help Voice server. Planned functionality:

 - [ ] Detecting "ask to ask" posts
 - [ ] Detecting thank you posts the other bot doesn't catch
 - [ ] Detecting payment offers
 - [ ] Detecting multiple reposts in different channels
 - [ ] Detecting overusing a single channel
 - [ ] Detecting ping abuse
 - [ ] Detecting "I have a test"
 - [ ] If you have another useful idea, make a GitHub feature request!
 - [ ] Planned humorous interactions...

### Deployment
You'll need the keys/tokens for the bot itself. Those are kept in a `secrets.py` file I can give you
if you have a good reason for using it!
