Does encouragement help athletes train harder? In the Unit 4 Review Exercises, you read about an experiment that attempted to answer this question. In the experiment, Coach Peace randomly assigned 24 of his players to an “encouragement group” and the remaining 23 players to a control group that didn’t receive extra encouragement. While one group waited outside the gym, the other group participated in a push-up contest in which the players did push-ups until exhausted. Both groups were given the exact same instructions about how to perform the push-ups as the coach counted out loud instructions about how to perform the push-ups as the coach counted out loud (“1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . .”), but the encouragement group was instructed to shout “Win!” between each push-up. The other group did not receive any additional instructions.

If there is convincing evidence that the players in the encouragement group had a greater ABILITY to do push-ups, should you conclude that shouting “Win!” between the push-ups was the cause of the increased ABILITY?",Homework Help Voice,academic-help-3,2021-05-11 15:58:48.472000,TheCptNubs,2017-04-18 00:30:57.893000,,,

8.44471047411335E+017,"Exercise 1:
In Svalbard, there are many companies that offer ""Polar Bear Safari"".
Assume that the market for ""Polar Bear Safari"" can be described through the following offers and
demand functions:

Supply: P = 50 + X Demand: P = 200 - 2X

(a) We assume that this market functions as a free competition market. Calculate
equilibrium price and quantity traded. Illustrate graphically the market solution.

(b) Calculate consumer surpluses, producer surpluses and socio-economic surpluses.

(c) Due to the Korona pandemic, several of the providers have gone bankrupt or closed down.

The consequence of this is that there is only one provider of ""Polar Bear Safari"" on Svalbard. Explain what
which characterizes the new market form and calculates the marginal revenue function (marginal revenue) of the provider.

(d) Now assume that the cost to the company is 𝑪 (𝑿) = 𝟐𝑿
𝟐 + 𝟓𝟎.
Calculate the number of units it is optimal to produce given that this company will maximize
their profit? Calculate what price the company will charge for the good?
(e) Compare the outcome in problem a and d. How will the economic welfare for
consumers be affected by the reduction in the number of providers?
